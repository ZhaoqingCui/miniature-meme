# X-Team 26 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will discuss our schedules and decide together who should complete a given task.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We'll check in with them a week before the deadline, and then again 2 or 3 days before the due date.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We have a group chat together, and can ask eachother questions. If it can't be solved remotely we'll meet in person.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Remind eachother of deadlines and check in a week before the due date.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Feel free to ask questions to eachother so we can help eachother.
